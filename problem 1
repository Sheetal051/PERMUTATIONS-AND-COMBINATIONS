Q:A round table conference is to be held among 25 delegates from 25 countries. In how many ways can they be seated if two particular delegates are always to sit together?
A. 23!
B. 2! ×23!
C. 3! ×23!
D. None of these
Ans:
Let's break this problem down step by step.

Since two particular delegates are always to sit together, we can consider them as a single unit. This means we have 24 "units" (23 individual delegates + 1 pair of delegates) to be seated around a round table.

The number of ways to arrange these 24 units around a round table is (24-1)! = 23!.

Now, within the pair of delegates, they can be arranged in 2! ways (i.e., delegate A on the left and delegate B on the right, or delegate B on the left and delegate A on the right).

So, the total number of ways to seat the delegates is 2! × 23!.

Therefore, the correct answer is B. 2! × 23!.
