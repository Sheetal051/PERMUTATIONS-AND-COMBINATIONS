Q:In how many ways can 15 people be seated around two round tables with seating capacities of 7 and 8 people?
A) 15!/(8!)            
B) 7!*8!            
C) (15C8)*6!*7!            
D)2*(15C7)*6!*7!
Ans:
We can choose 7 people from the 15 to sit at the table with a capacity of 7, which can be done in 15C7 ways.

Then, we arrange these 7 people around the table, which can be done in 6! ways (since it's a circular table).

The remaining 8 people will sit at the other table, and we can arrange them in 7! ways.

However, we need to consider the fact that the two tables are identical, so we need to multiply the result by 2 to account for the fact that we could have chosen the other table for the 7 people.

Therefore, the total number of ways to seat the 15 people is 2*(15C7)*6!*7!.

So, the correct answer is option D) 2*(15C7)*6!*7!.
