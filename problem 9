Q:How many ways can 10 letters be posted in 5 post boxes, if each of the post
boxes can take more than 10 letters?
A) 510                  
B) 105           
C) 10P5 
D) 10C5
Ans:
Since each post box can take more than 10 letters, we can consider each letter as distinct and assign it to any of the 5 post boxes.

So, for each of the 10 letters, we have 5 options (post boxes) to choose from.

Using the fundamental counting principle, we multiply the number of options for each letter:

5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 × 5 = 5^10

Therefore, there are 5^10 = 9765625 ways to post 10 letters in 5 post boxes.

None of the provided choices (A) 510, (B) 105, (C) 10P5, (D) 10C5 are correct in this context. The correct answer is:

5^10=9765625
