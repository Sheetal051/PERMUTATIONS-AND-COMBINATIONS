Q:A selection is to be made for one post of principal and two posts of vice-principal amongst the six candidates called for the interview only two are eligible for the post of principal while they all are eligible for the post of vice-principal. The number of possible combinations of selectees is:
A. 4
B. 12
C. 18
D. 20
Ans:
1.For the post of Principal, there are 2 eligible candidates, so we can select 1 principal in 2C1 = 2 ways.
2.For the post of Vice-Principal, there are 6 eligible candidates (including the 2 who are eligible for Principal). We need to select 2 Vice-Principals from the remaining 5 candidates (since 1 is already selected as Principal). This can be done in 5C2 = 10 ways.

Now, we multiply the number of ways to select the Principal with the number of ways to select the Vice-Principals:

2 (ways to select Principal) * 10 (ways to select Vice-Principals) = 20

So, the correct answer is D) 20.
