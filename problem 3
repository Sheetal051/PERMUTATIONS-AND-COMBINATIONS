Q:In how many ways can the letters of the word 'LEADER' be arranged?
A. 72
B. 144
C. 360
D. 720
Ans:
The word "LEADER" has 6 letters, but it has 2 Es, which are identical. Therefore, we need to divide the total number of permutations by the number of ways to arrange the identical Es.
The total number of permutations is 6! = 6 × 5 × 4 × 3 × 2 × 1 = 720

Since there are 2 identical Es, we need to divide by 2! = 2 × 1 = 2

So, the correct number of ways to arrange the letters in the word "LEADER" is:

720 ÷ 2 = 360

Therefore, the correct answer is:
C. 360
