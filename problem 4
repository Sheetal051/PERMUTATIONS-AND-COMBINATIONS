Q:A box contains 2 white balls, 3 black balls and 4 red balls. In how many ways can 3 balls be drawn from the box, if at least one black ball is to be included in the draw?
A. 32
B. 48
C. 64
D. 96
Ans:
Case 1: 1 black ball and 2 non-black balls

Choose 1 black ball out of 3 in ³C₁ = 3 ways
Choose 2 non-black balls out of 6 (2 white and 4 red) in ⁶C₂ = 15 ways
Since the order of the non-black balls doesn't matter, we use combinations. However, the order of the 3 balls does matter, so we multiply by 3! (the number of permutations of 3 balls): 3 × 15 × 3! = 3 × 15 × 6 = 270

Case 2: 2 black balls and 1 non-black ball

Choose 2 black balls out of 3 in ³C₂ = 3 ways
Choose 1 non-black ball out of 6 (2 white and 4 red) in ⁶C₁ = 6 ways
Again, the order of the 3 balls matters, so we multiply by 3!: 3 × 6 × 3! = 3 × 6 × 6 = 108
Case 3: 3 black balls

Choose 3 black balls out of 3 in ³C₃ = 1 way
The order of the 3 balls matters, so we multiply by 3!: 1 × 3! = 1 × 6 = 6

Now, let's add up the number of ways for all three cases: 270 + 108 + 6 = 384

However, we notice that we've overcounted. For example, in Case 1, we counted the arrangement "black-white-red" separately from "white-black-red", even though they're the same. To correct this, we divide the total by 3! (the number of permutations of 3 balls): 384 ÷ 3! = 384 ÷ 6 = 64

Therefore, the correct answer is: C. 64
