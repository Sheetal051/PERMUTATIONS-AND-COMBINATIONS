A. 168
B. 176
C. 186
D. 196
Ans:
To find the number of ways the gentleman can begin to write a letter, we need to calculate the product of the number of choices for each item:

There are 6 choices for the note paper.
There are 7 choices for the ink-stand.
There are 4 choices for the pen.
The total number of ways to choose all three items is:

6 × 7 × 4 = 168

Therefore, the correct answer is:
A. 168
