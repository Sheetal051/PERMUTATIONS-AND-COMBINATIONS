Q:. In how many different ways can five friends sit for a photograph of five chairs in a row?
A. 120 ways 
B. 24 ways 
C. 240 ways 
D. 720 ways
Ans:
This is a classic permutation problem. Since there are 5 friends and 5 chairs, each friend can sit in any of the 5 chairs. We can arrange them as follows:

The first friend can sit in any of the 5 chairs (5 options)
The second friend can sit in any of the remaining 4 chairs (4 options)
The third friend can sit in any of the remaining 3 chairs (3 options)
The fourth friend can sit in any of the remaining 2 chairs (2 options)
The fifth friend can sit in the only remaining chair (1 option)
To find the total number of ways, we multiply the options at each step:

5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
So, the correct answer is A) 120 ways.
