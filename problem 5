Q: How many numbers greater than a million can be formed with the digits 2,3,0,4,3,3,3 ?
A. 300
B. 360
C. 440
D. 620
Ans:
Let's break this down step by step!

We want to form numbers greater than a million, which means the number should have at least 7 digits (since 1,000,000 is a 7-digit number).

We have 7 digits available: 2, 3, 0, 4, 3, 3, and 3. We can use each digit only as many times as it appears in the given set.

To form a 7-digit number greater than a million, we need to ensure that the first digit (the most significant digit) is not 0. If it were 0, the number would be less than a million. So, we have 3 options for the first digit: 2, 3, or 4.

For each of these 3 options, we can arrange the remaining 6 digits in different ways. We have 6 digits left, and we need to arrange them in 6 positions. Since some digits are repeated (we have 4 threes), we need to use the concept of permutations with repetition.

The number of ways to arrange the 6 digits is:
6! / (3! × 1! × 1!) = 360

So, the total number of 6-digit numbers greater than a million that can be formed is: 360

Therefore, the correct answer is:
B. 360
