Q:How many different words can be formed from the alphabets of the word SCISSORS?
A. 1440 
B. 1680
C. 1800 
D. 2100
Ans:
To determine how many different words can be formed from the alphabets of the word SCISSORS, we start by noting that the word SCISSORS consists of 8 letters with some repetitions.

The word SCISSORS contains:
S: 4 times
C: 1 time
I: 1 time
O: 1 time
R: 1 time
The total number of distinct permutations of these letters can be calculated using the formula for permutations of a multiset:
Number of permutations=
n!/n1!*n2!*.....*nk!
where n is the total number of letters, and n1,n2,....nk are the frequencies of the repeated letters.
For SCISSORS, we have:
Total letters (n) = 8
Frequencies :S=4,C=1,I=1,O=1,R=1

Thus, the number of different words is given by:
Number of permutations=
8!/4!*1!*1!*1!*1!

First, calculate 8!:
8!=8×7×6×5×4×3×2×1=40320

Next, calculate 4!:
4!=4×3×2×1=24

Now, compute the number of permutations:

Number of permutations =
40320/24 = 1680
Therefore, the number of different words that can be formed from the alphabets of the word SCISSORS is: 1680 (option B)
