Q:In how many ways can the letters of the word EDUCATION be rearranged so that the relative position of the vowels and consonants remain the same as in the word EDUCATION?
A) 9!/4    
B) 9!/(4!*5!)
C) 4!*5!
D) None of these
Ans:
The vowels (E, U, A, I, O) can be rearranged among themselves in 5! ways. The consonants (D, C, T, N) can be rearranged among themselves in 4! ways.

Since the vowels and consonants are independent of each other, we multiply the number of ways to rearrange the vowels and consonants to get the total number of ways to rearrange the letters: 5!*4!.

Therefore, the correct answer is D) None of these, as the correct answer is 5!*4!, which is not among the options.
